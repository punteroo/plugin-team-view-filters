# Flex UI v2.x - Custom TeamsView Filters Fix
This is a fork of [the official Twilio repo](https://github.com/twilio-professional-services/plugin-team-view-filters) to workaround a bug on custom filters present on UI v2.3.2

## Disclaimer and Notice
⚠️ A bug is present on Flex UI v2.3.2 in filter definitions where **options should have the same value both on `label` and `value`** or else they won't work (even when the actual query is formed with the `value` property). Keep this in mind when looking through the code to know why it's programmed that way, it's on purpose. I've left comments in-code for every weird thing done to make this work explaining exactly why.

Keep an eye on the Flex UI update notes to know when this is fixed, this has already been reported.

## Flex Plugins
Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

## Overview
The Twilio Flex Team View allows for real-time monitoring of Flex agents and supports filtering those agents based on Twilio TaskRouter worker attributes. This plugin allows the usage of checkboxes with different label names while internally using a workaround to make `multiValue` filters [like the one seen in the official docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/team-view-filters#add-a-multivalue-field) work.

If you wish to see examples of implementing other types of filters, use the one set here as an example to modify yours and adapt accordingly.

## Requirements

### Team View Filters

To use this plugin, you should enable the Team View Filters feature on your Flex instance, and you can do that on the [pre-release features page](https://flex.twilio.com/admin/features/). On the Feature Settings page, go to the _Pilot_ tab, and enable the _Advanced Teams Views Filters_.


## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
$ cd plugin-team-view-filters
$ npm i

# In case you get dependency errors when installing `@twilio-paste/core` and `@twilio-paste/icons`
$ npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the **Twilio CLI** to deploy a local Flex UI server:

```bash
$ twilio flex plugins start -l debug
```

This will automatically start up Flex UI and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

## Deploy

When you are ready to deploy your plugin, in your terminal run:

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Notes for this version"
```

If the deployment succeeds, you will get a success message like the example below. Make sure to run the "Next Steps" section to enable the newly published version of your plugin:

```

For more details on deploying your plugin, refer to the [deploying your plugin guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli/deploy-and-release).

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.
